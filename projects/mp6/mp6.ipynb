    "### Q13: Geographic Plotting of Postal Codes\n",
    "\n",
    "In this question, you will plot geographic data from `locations.geojson` over a background map from the shapefile `\"shapes/cb_2018_us_state_20m.shp\"`. Each point represents an address and should be colored by its **postal code**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the instructions **carefully**, as this question involves geospatial data manipulation that is sensitive to the order of operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Required Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Extract ZIP codes from the address column:\n",
    "   - Use a regular expression to extract the **5-digit** ZIP code from the address string.\n",
    "   - Ignore entries with missing or malformed ZIP codes.\n",
    "   - If a ZIP code has a state and then the code, make sure to only take the 5 digit code. For example, only use `93821` in `CA 93821`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Filter valid ZIP codes:\n",
    "   - Only keep rows where the ZIP code is a number between **10000** and **60000**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Crop the data to a specific bounding box (do this **before** projecting):\n",
    "   - Define the bounding box:  \n",
    "     `west = -90`, `east = -65`, `south = 25`, `north = 50`\n",
    "   - Use `shapely.geometry.box(west, south, east, north)` to create a bounding box and either `.intersection()` to crop the background or `.intersects()` to filter the data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Project to Mercator (\"epsg:2022\"):\n",
    "   - After filtering, apply `.to_crs(\"epsg:2022\")` **to both** the background and the locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Plot:\n",
    "   - Use `.plot(ax=ax)` and be sure to **pass the same `ax` object** to both the background and the points.\n",
    "   - Set:\n",
    "     - Background color to `\"lightgray\"`\n",
    "     - Point colors using the `\"viridis\"` colormap\n",
    "     - Color of each point should represent the ZIP code using `column=\"zipcode\"` in `.plot(...)`.\n",
    "     - Add a colorbar with `legend=True`\n",
    "     - Remove axis labels with `ax.set_axis_off()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The result should look similar to this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/geo.png\" width=\"400px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Do not project before filtering or intersecting with the bounding box.** Always crop in latitude/longitude (the original coordinate system) first.\n",
    "- Use `re.findall(regex, address)` to extract ZIP codes.\n",
    "- Clean the data **before** plotting.\n",
    "- If your map looks distorted or blank, double-check that you projected **after** cropping and used the correct EPSG code.\n",
    "- Double-check the ZIP code range: it must be between 10000 and 60000.\n",
    "- Use `legend=True` for the colorbar.\n"
