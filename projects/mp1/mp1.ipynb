    "1. Consider starting by splitting the string into a list of strings. Notice that they are all separated by `-`. \n",
    "2. To ignore case, it's often easy to use a string method to make everything uppercase or lowercase.\n",
    "3. To get a single character from a string `s`, you can use `s[INDEX]`. 0 is the first character, 1 is the second, and so on. Python supports negative indexing, meaning `s[-1]` is the last letter, `s[-2]` is the next to last, etc. You can also slice strings to get a substring by putting a colon between two indexes `s[inclusive_start:exclusive_end]`. You can leave off one of the indexes to go to the start or end of the string. For example, `filepath[:7]` would evaluate to `\"TESTING\"`.\n",
    "4. In Java, you compare strings with `s1.equals(s2)`, but in Python the correct equivalent is `s1 == s2`. The equivalent of Java's `==` is Python's rarely used `is` operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to built-ins, Python defines several methods for specific objects like strings. Skim the string methods here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods. Some important ones: `find`, `isdigit`, `join`, `split`, `lower`, `upper`, `strip`, `replace`."
