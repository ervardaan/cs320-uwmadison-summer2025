    "\n",
    "For part 1 of this machine project, you will be working to create custom classes for handling data related to loans. These classes will allow us to easily take in large amounts of data and format it in a way that is easy for us to work with and analyze. \n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, finish the `Applicant` and `Loan` classes from [Lab 3](../../labs/Lab3/README.md) (if you haven't already done so). These classes hold data about people who apply to loans and other data related to loans respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll now add a `Bank` class to `loans.py` file that can keep track of some bank information as well as a list of `Loan` objects that are tied to this bank.  A `Bank` object can be created like this (create a class with the necessary constructor for this to work):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "lcu = loans.Bank(\"Landmark Credit Union\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### banks.json\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__init__` of your `Bank` class should check that the given name appears in the `banks.json` file.  If it does, the `__init__` should also lookup the `lei` (\"Legal Entity Identifier\") corresponding to the name and store that in an `lei` attribute.  In other words, `lcu.lei` should give the LEI for LCU, in this case \"549300KY533JFETOYG46\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Try to avoid reading in the `banks.json` file each time you create a new `Bank` object. Instead, try defining it outside of the `Bank` class to optimize the creation of new `Bank` objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### wi.zip\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__init__` should also iterate over the loan data from the CSV inside of `wi.zip` and either skip the loan data if the `lei` doesn't match that of the `Bank` object, or create a `Loan` object from the loan data if the `lei` does match and append it to a list that is stored as an attribute in the `Bank` object called `loan_list`. For example, someone should be able to call `lcu.loan_list` to get a list of all of the `Loan` objects that have the same `lei` as the `Bank` object we created above.\n",
    "\n",
    "You already learned how to read text from a zip file in lab using `TextIOWrapper` and the `zipfile` module. Read the documentation and example for how to read CSV files with `DictReader` here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.DictReader.  You can combine this with what you learned about zipfiles.  When you create a `DictReader`, just pass in a `TextIOWrapper` object instead of a regular file object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Special Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this new `loan_list` attribute, you are able to print the last loan for this `Bank` object using:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "print(lcu.loan_list[-1])\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "Add the special methods to `Bank` necessary to make the above two lines of code work.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Running `python3 tester.py` does two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compute a score based on whether answers in your `mp3.ipynb` are correct.\n",
    "2. Get a second score by running `module_tester.py`, which exercises various classes/methods in `loan.py` (already done) and `search.py` (the next part)\n",
    "\n",
    "Your total score is an average of these two components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try running `python3 module_tester.py` now.  You should see the following (assuming you haven't worked ahead on `search.py`):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{'score': 40.0, 'errors': ['could not find search module']}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It should actually be possible to get 50.0 from `module_tester.py`\n",
    "after just completing `loans.py`, but we left some tests undone so you\n",
    "can get practice writing tests for yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open `module_tester.py` and take a look at the `loans_test`.  The\n",
    "function tries different things (e.g., creating different `Loan` and\n",
    "`Applicant` objects and calling various methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever something works, a global variable `loans_points` is\n",
    "increased.  There are also asserts, and if any fail, the test stops\n",
    "giving points.  For example, here's a bit that tests the `lower_age`\n",
    "method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    # lower_age\n",
    "    assert loans.Applicant(\"<25\", []).lower_age() == 25\n",
    "    assert loans.Applicant(\"20-30\", []).lower_age() == 20\n",
    "    assert loans.Applicant(\">75\", []).lower_age() == 75\n",
    "    loans_points += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirement: Additional tests in `module_tester.py`\n",
    "You should add some additional test code of your choosing \n",
    "(based on where you think bugs are most likely to occur).  When the \n",
    "additional code shows that `loans.py` works correctly, it should add 4 \n",
    "points to `loan_points`.  You could do this is one step (`loans_points += 4`),\n",
    "or better, divide the points over the testing of a few different\n",
    "aspects.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are not any specific requirements for additional testing -- just make sure \n",
    "that you do add a new test (or more) and then give yourself more points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Debugging the Module Tester\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are not currently passing the module tester, it is likely that you are failing one of the test cases which are created using `assert`. One common way of debugging these errors is by using print debugging. Here is an example of how print debugging might work for this machine project:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say the following `assert` statement is failing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "...\n",
    "assert loans.Applicant(\"<25\", []).lower_age() == 25\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding a print statement above this line with `loans.Applicant(\"<25\", []).lower_age()` will let us know the output of this code. So our code would now look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "...\n",
    "print(loans.Applicant(\"<25\", []).lower_age())\n",
    "assert loans.Applicant(\"<25\", []).lower_age() == 25\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "From here, we will be able to see what our code is outputting and can modify our code accordingly. For example, if we see that our code is printing `'25'`, we now know that our code is outputting a string instead of an int, and we can make the appropriate change in `loans.py` before rerunning the module tester.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 2: Binary Search Tree\n",
    "> 📄 **Work in:** [`search.py`](search.py)\n",
    "\n",
    "For part 2 of this machine project, you will be creating custom classes for a `Node` and `BST` data structures. These classes will allow us to lookup specific `Loan` objects efficiently as we will see in the questions below.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, finish the `Node` and `BST` classes from [Lab 4](../../labs/Lab4/README.md) (if you haven't already done so). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** if we haven't gotten to BSTs in lecture and lab yet, you can still work on some of the questions in parts 3 and 4, but you should wait to work on the ones related to trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Special Method\n",
