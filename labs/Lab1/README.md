1. You are free to form groups with others. We recommend groups of 4-7 members. You can sign up to your group under Canvas - People - Study Group Self Sign Up. 

2. Get to know your group members, asking each other the following:

- Name + major
- What is your hometown, and what is your favorite place there?
- If you could create a silly law, what would it be?

3. Setup your [virtual machine](./vm)
