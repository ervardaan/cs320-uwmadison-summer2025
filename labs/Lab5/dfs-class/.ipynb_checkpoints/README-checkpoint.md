# Inheritance and DFS

## Inheritance

Paste and run the following code in a new python notebook called debug.ipynb in your mp4 folder:

```python
class Parent:
    def twice(self):
        self.message()
        self.message()
        
    def message(self):
        print("parent says hi")
        
class Child:
    def message(self):
        print("child says hi")
        
c = Child()
```

Modify `Child` so that it inherits from `Parent`.

What do you think will be printed if you call `c.twice()`?  Discuss
with your group, then run it to find out.

When `self.some_method(...)` is called, and there are multiple methods
named `some_method` in your program, the type of `self` (the original object that is calling the method from the class) is what
matters for determining which one runs.  It doesn't matter where the
`self.some_method(...)` is (could be any method).

## GraphSearcher

Copy and paste the following starter code (which you'll build on in the project):

```python
class GraphSearcher:
    def __init__(self):
        self.visited = set()
        self.order = []

    def visit_and_get_children(self, node):
        """ 
        Leave this method as is! It will be over-written the child classes
        Each child class should perform the following:
            Record the node value in self.order AND return its children
            parameter: node
            return: children of the given node
        """
        raise Exception("must be overridden in sub classes -- don't change me here!")

    def dfs_search(self, node):
        # 1. clear out visited set and order list
        # 2. start recursive search by calling dfs_visit

    def dfs_visit(self, node):
        # 1. if this node has already been visited, just `return` (no value necessary)
        # 2. mark node as visited by adding it to the set
        # 3. call self.visit_and_get_children(node) to get the children
        # 4. in a loop, call dfs_visit on each of the children
```

### Be sure to read these notes:

The graphs we search on for this project come in many shapes and formats
(e.g. matrices, files or web), but it would be nice if we could use
the same depth-first search (DFS) code when we want to search
different kinds of graphs.  Therefore, we would like to implement a
base class `GraphSearcher` and implement the DFS algorithm in it.
This is also why visit_and_get_children will need to be different for 
each child class, as the parent-child relationship is defined in different
ways for each type format.

For our purposes, we aren't using DFS to find a specific path.  We
just want to see what nodes are reachable from a given starting
`node`, so these methods don't need to return any value.  Your job is
to replace the comments in `dfs_search` and `dfs_visit` with code
(some comments may require a couple lines of code).

The `dfs_visit` method will call `visit_and_get_children` to record
the node value and determine the children of a given node. Subclasses
of `GraphSearcher` can override `visit_and_get_children` to lookup the
children of a node in different kinds of graphs (e.g. matrices, files
or web).


Try your code:

```python
g = GraphSearcher()
g.dfs_search("A")
```

You should get an exception.  The purpose of `GraphSearcher` is not to
directly create objects, it is to let other clases inherit
`dfs_search` (we'll do the inheritance soon).

## Matrix Format

Paste and run the following:

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame([
    [0,1,0,1],
    [0,0,1,0],
    [0,0,0,1],
    [0,0,1,0],
], index=["A", "B", "C", "D"], columns=["A", "B", "C", "D"])
df
```

A grid of ones and zeros like this is a common way to represent
directed graphs.  A `1` in the "C" column of the "B" row means that
there is an edge from node B to node C.

Try drawing a directed graph on a piece of paper based on the above
grid.

`df.loc["????"]` looks up a row in a DataFrame.  Use it to lookup the
children of node B.

Complete the following to print all the children of "B" (should only be "C"):

```python
for node, has_edge in df.loc["B"].items():
    if ????:
        print(????)
```

Let's create a class that inherits from `GraphSearcher` and works with
graphs represented as matrices:

```python
class MatrixSearcher(????):
    def __init__(self, df):
        super().????() # call constructor method of parent class
        self.df = df

    def visit_and_get_children(self, node):
        # TODO: Record the node value in self.order
        children = []
        # TODO: use `self.df` to determine what children the node has and append them
        return children
```

Complete the `????` and `TODO` parts.  Test it, checking what nodes
are reachable from each starting point:

```python
m = MatrixSearcher(df)
m.dfs_search(????)
m.order
```

From "A", for example, `m.order` should be `['A','B', 'C', 'D']`.  Look
back at the picture you drew of the graph and make sure you're getting
what you expect when starting from other nodes.

## scrape.py

If you've been doing this work in a notebook, you should now move your
code to a new module called `scrape.py` in your `mp4` directory.
