# Lab 4: BST

1. We have the detailed mortgage dataset we're using for MP3 thanks to the 1975 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. Discuss with your group: *If you could pass a law requiring the collection and release of a new dataset, what data would you choose?* Feel free to answer based on what you think would be fun or interesting, or you can think about how your dataset might bring more transparency to a societal issue (like how the HDMA data makes it easier to monitor for discriminatory lending practices).

2. Inside this folder, there is a notebook `debug/self/main.ipynb`. Open it and fix the bugs. 

3. Create a [binary search tree](./bst-groups/README.md) for use in MP3. 


# Screenshot Requirement
1. A screenshot showing the successfully debugged `main.ipynb`` notebook.
2. A screenshot of your binary search tree implementation.
