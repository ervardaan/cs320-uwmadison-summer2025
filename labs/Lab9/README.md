# Lab 9: Geopandas

1. Double check that Geopands and Geopy are installed with

```
pip show geopandas
pip show geopy
````

2. Try to fix the bugs in the [`main.ipynb`](./9-geo/main.ipynb).  There is a [`solution.ipynb`](./9-geo/solution.ipynb) too, but only peek as a last resort!

3. Continue working on [Part 3 of MP6](EDGAR.md).
