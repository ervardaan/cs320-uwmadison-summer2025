# Lab 7: Flask

1. Double check that flask is installed, with 
```
pip show flask
```

If you receive no output from this command talk to your TA

2. Work through [part 1](./flask-struture/part1.ipynb) and [part 2](./flask-struture/part2.py) in the flask-structure directory. 

3. Practice debugging a sample webpage in Lab7/webpage. The page can be accessed by running `python3 website.py` in terminal from the correct directory, then visiting external_ip:5000 in a browser. Try changing the home page to instead display the click through rate.
